    # TODO: Before we deal with the LEDs, generate random locations for
    # the character, box, and target. static locations have been provided
    # for the (x,y) coordinates for each of these elements within the 8x8
    # grid. 
    # There is a rand function, but note that it isn't very good! You 
    # should at least make sure that none of the items are on top of each
    # other.
   
    # TODO: Now, light up the playing field. Add walls around the edges
    # and light up the character, box, and target with the colors you have
    # chosen. (Yes, you choose, and you should document your choice.)
    # Hint: the LEDs are an array, so you should be able to calculate 
    # offsets from the (0, 0) LED.

    # TODO: Enter a loop and wait for user input. Whenever user input is
    # received, update the grid with the new location of the player (and
    # if applicable, box and target). You will also need to restart the
    # game if the user requests it and indicate when the box is located
    # in the same position as the target.

    # TODO: That's the base game! Now, pick a pair of enhancements and
    # consider how to implement them.
